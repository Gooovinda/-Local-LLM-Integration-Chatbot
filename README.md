** Text Similarity API with FastAPI **

A REST API built with FastAPI that measures similarity between two text inputs. Using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, it returns a score that reflects how closely the texts are related.

ðŸ“Œ**Objective**
Develop an API that allows users to send two text inputs and receive an instant similarity score.

ðŸš€ **Key Highlights**

ðŸ§  TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity: Computes similarity between two text strings.

ðŸš€ FastAPI Backend: Provides a high-performance REST API endpoint.

ðŸ–¥ JSON Response: Clean output, easy to integrate with other systems.

ðŸ”§ Reusable Service: Can be extended to chatbots, search engines, or recommendation systems.

ðŸ“Š **Tech Stack**

Python

FastAPI

Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer, Cosine Similarity)

Uvicorn (server)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

No external dataset required.

Input text comes from the user (via API request).

ðŸ§ª Example Usage
Request:

POST /similarity  
{  
  "text1": "I love machine learning",  
  "text2": "Machine learning is amazing"  
}  


Response:

{  
  "similarity_score": 0.87  
}
